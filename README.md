# Cooperative-Spectrum-Sensing-Using-Cognitive-Radio
Bachelor Thesis
Cognitive Radios have been advanced as a technology for the opportunistic use of under-utilized spectrum since they are able to sense the spectrum and use frequency bands if no Primary user is detected.
Cooperative spectrum sensing is where number of CRs take decision and pass it to Fusion centre. The improvement in probability pf detection seen is because od spatial diversity.
